# Quality Control Platform ðŸ“±ðŸŽ“

The platform for the analysis and results of quality control is my original engineering project. Its functions allow you to manage the product quality control process performed by a quality controller. It is a platform that can be displayed as a mobile application and website. Preferred use: an employee using a mobile application, and a manager using a website.

## Technology stack
The application was programmed using the **Ionic Framework** and **Angular**. The server part is performed by a web-api application written in **.NET Core (Entity Framework Core)**. The data is stored in an **SQL database**. The application is connected to the **Firebase** server responsible for storing encrypted login data and media, e.g. photos, digital signatures.

## Features

- Logging in via the Firebase server
- Module for assigning a role on the platform (employee or manager)
- Create a digital report on the quality control process
- Take a photo and upload it to the Firebase server
- Make a digital signature
- Export the report as a PDF file
- Accept, reject or correct the report (as manager)
- View report statistics in the form of graphs *
###### * - requires development and correction

## Development

I have a lot of ideas for developing this application. First of all, I would like to expand and improve the charting module. Then I would like to completely introduce cloud services like Azure. In addition, you can develop the statistics module very well and combine it with the generation of digital reports.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots from the application.

The first screenshot shows the ability to choose an app theme. Light or dark. The next two screenshots show the form for creating a new report.

The following images present other functionalities of the application for the employee.

The screenshot below shows the same login page displayed as an app or website. Logging in to the application looks the same regardless of the platform, but it is the user's role that decides what view will appear after logging in.

The following screenshots show the view of the supervisor and the functionalities that he can use, i.e. charts with statistics, acceptance, rejection or correction of reports, registering new employees or generating an accepted and ready report.
